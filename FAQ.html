                <h4>Q: What are the benefits of joining Engineering House? </h4>
            </header>
            <p>A: Engineering House provides a wealth of opportunities that you can’t get anywhere else at RIT. The access to tools in a workshop setting gives the ability to easily work on projects, and building such projects is an amazing resume booster. There are also many 3rd-5th years who have a wealth of knowledge about upperclassmen classes and co-op opportunities, who are always willing to help. Upperclassmen are always willing to help tutor and help with classwork at any time. Access to free printing and 3-D printing is a pretty good perk, too. We have a movie theater as well which is awesome for playing our VR and watching movies with friends. </p>
            <header>
                <h4>Q: What is the commitment like as a member of Engineering House?</h4>
            </header>
            <p>A: An active member of Engineering House will go to events and take part in projects, along with going to weekly House meetings and regularly interacting with other members. This may sound like a lot, but it all becomes second nature due to the instant friendships you make in this organization. Events consist of movie nights, painting, and VR game nights. Projects such as the Human Hamster Wheel or Big Bertha are interesting to any engineer, and are great resume boosters, so putting time into these is not detrimental. Weekly House meetings are at 9pm on Sundays, and take an hour, max. They are not long and it is the best way to know of upcoming fun events to join! All in all, what you put in is what you get out of it, and you can be as little or as much active as you’d like to be. </p>
            <header>
                <h4>Q: Is Engineering House one floor? Is it a house? What the heck???</h4>
            </header>
            <p>A: Engineering House is located on the eighth floor of Fredericka Douglass Sprague Hall, DSP (formerly Nathaniel Rochester Hall, NRH) and is one floor of dorm rooms. 47 on-floor members comprised of first and second years live here, but there are off-floor members who live elsewhere who are also a part of the organization. </p>
            <header>
                <h4>Q: What’s it like being an off-floor member? </h4>
            </header>
            <p>A: Off-floor members are the same as on-floor members, the only difference being where you sleep! It takes a little more commitment, just due to the effort of traveling all the way up to the eighth floor of Fredericka Douglass Sprague Hall, DSP (formerly Nathaniel Rochester Hall, NRH). If you are especially active in the organization, you even have the ability to become an on-floor member in your second year! There are on-floor and off-floor members in cabinet, as well, so truly there is no difference in terms of status. </p>
            <header>
                <h4>Q: What happens if we select a roommate but are then accepted to Engineering House?</h4>
            </header>
            <p>A: You will have the choice of living on-floor or staying with your roommate! If you choose to live with your roommate, you can still be an off-floor member. </p>
            <header>
                <h4>Q: What is the cost to join Engineering House? </h4>
            </header>
            <p>A: Off-Floor dues are $40 per semester, and on-floor dues are $80 per semester. This is to help fund House projects and allows us to buy 3-D printer filament, which is free for house members to use. </p>
            <header>
                <h4>Q: How do I join? </h4>
            </header>
            <p>A: Applications can be found in your housing contract if you are a freshman, or you can find us at the Activities Fair! Check out our <a href="Membership.html">Membership page</a> for more information! </p>
